## 🛠️ Technical Notes

The software is developed in Python. Core modules include:

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| tkinter | GUI interface |
| requests | API requests |
| json | Response parsing |
| pandas | CSV export |
| logging | Runtime logging |

The software collects data through interface requests and does not rely on browser automation or RPA-style operations. During collection, results are saved by page by default. The request interval is usually about 1-2 seconds, which helps control the collection pace and reduce data loss caused by unexpected interruptions.

## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need to install Python?

No. The software is packaged as a desktop client. Download the version for your operating system and run it directly.

### What is the cookie used for?

The cookie allows the software to access platform data under your current account session. Please use your own account cookie and keep related files secure.

### Will collected data be lost if the task is interrupted?

The software saves CSV files by page instead of waiting until the whole task is complete. If the task is interrupted, data from completed pages is usually still preserved in the result files.

### Where are result files saved?

By default, result files are saved in the software directory. Log files are saved in the `logs` directory.

### How much data can it collect?

The actual amount of data depends on the keyword, account status, platform API response, network environment, and collection frequency. It is recommended to set a reasonable collection range and request interval.

### What should I do if an error occurs?

Check the log files under the `logs` directory first. When reporting an issue, please provide:

- Software version
- Operating system
- Feature module used
- Keyword, profile link, or video link entered
- Error screenshot
- Log content around the time when the error occurred
